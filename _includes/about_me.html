<p class="p2">I am currently a junior at Rice University majoring in computer science, and am very interested in expanding my programming and analytical skill set through an internship next summer in the Bay Area. Ideally, I would like to work for a smaller or mid-sized innovative technology company. </p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">During the summer after my first year at Rice, I gained experience in business analytics working for an NBA team, utilizing data manipulation, visualization, and predictive modeling to inform and improve ticket sales. Last summer, I worked for Olo, a leading digital food ordering platform, doing back-end software design creating a composite logging service and data dashboard design to reflect the health of their coupon business. I am proficient in C#, Java, Python and R, and I have taken coursework in data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented design, as well as math and statistics. Outside of the classroom, I work as a peer instructor through Rice’s Fondren Library teaching a course in data visualization and data structures in R, and am also developing an Introduction to GitHub course.  In addition, I am working on a startup developing a mobile (and eventually web) application for reselling and trading sneakers. </p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">I strongly believe in the power of data-driven decision making, and for the coming summer would welcome the opportunity to assist a company with similar values as well as continuing to develop my skills in either software engineering or data and analytics.  In employment and academic settings I have worked well on both solo projects and in collaboration with teams, and believe these attributes would be an asset to a technology-oriented opportunity.</p>
